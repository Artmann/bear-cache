The first snow came early in Chicago this year. It was barely November and we
were driving to an appointment. It was snowing, and then all of a sudden it went
from “really charming” to “wow it’s really coming down!” We sat in the cold car
way too long, wearing way too-light coats, staring at brake lights and a grey
sky. I thought – really – what have we done?? I write a blog about vegetables,
I’m shooting a book that’s due before May (when the spring farmers markets open)
and we’ve moved so far from the sun!

We got to where we were going – an industrial area in the Pullman neighborhood
where, situated on the roof of the Method production facility, is
[Gotham Greens.](http://gothamgreens.com/) I’ve been obsessed with their locally
grown greens since the moment I came across their deliciously spicy arugula
earlier this year. We got a tour of their rooftop greenhouse, and even though it
was cold and miserable outside, it was so warm and sunny up there. There was a
sea of the softest butter lettuces, my favorite spicy arugula, and the loveliest
scent of fresh basil.

Later that night, with a fridge full of greens and a pantry full of not much
else, I made my go-to quick & easy dinner: this five minute pesto pasta. We
weren’t about to head out into the snow for any additional groceries, and
really, nothing beats pasta in terms of combining bold flavor and easy prep.

#### How to Make Pesto Pasta

As I said above, making pesto pasta is easy. Here’s all you need to do:

1.  Blend up a batch of my
    [6-ingredient basil pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/pesto-recipe/), or
    use store-bought pesto in a pinch.
2.  Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the
    package directions.
3.  Before draining the pasta, reserve some of the starchy pasta water. Then,
    add 1/4 cup of this pasta water back into the pot with your pesto, and stir
    to thin the pesto.
4.  Toss in the cooked pasta, and mix until the pesto thoroughly coats it.
5.  Add a big handful of arugula and toss until it’s barely wilted.
6.  Finish everything with a big squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, red pepper
    flakes, and toasted pine nuts.

Dig in!

#### Pesto Pasta Recipe Tips

Never made pesto pasta before? Here are a few tips to get you started:

- **Reserve some pasta water.** My #1 pesto pasta tip! The salty, starchy pasta
  water will loosen the pesto enough to make a light sauce over the pasta.
  Because of its salty, starchy quality, this water will make a more flavorful,
  thicker final pesto sauce than regular water would.
- **Add the greens at the last minute.** I like my greens to be just slightly
  wilted, not totally limp. Toss them in at the last minute so that the hot
  pasta can wilt them, and then serve right away, while they still have a little
  crunch and vibrant color.
- **Taste and adjust.** Pestos vary in brightness, saltiness, and overall
  intensity of flavor, so make sure you taste and adjust your final dish before
  serving. Depending on your pesto, you might need to add an extra squeeze of
  lemon, a pinch of salt, or a big grind of black pepper to make your pesto
  pasta sing.

#### Pesto Pasta Recipe Variations

Like all simple recipes, this one’s fun to play with. Here are a few ideas to
change it up:

- No pine nuts on hand? Use walnuts or almonds instead.
- Finish the dish with spinach or kale in place of arugula, or skip the greens
  altogether.
- Try using [kale pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/kale-pesto/) instead of
  basil for a cold weather variation.
- Garnish the final dish with a few fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes,
  [roasted cauliflower](https://www.loveandlemons.com/roasted-cauliflower/), or
  [asparagus](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-cook-asparagus/).
- Stir in some mini mozzarella balls or a sprinkle of capers.
- Swap the spaghetti for your favorite pasta shape, or use
  [spaghetti squash](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-cook-spaghetti-squash/)
  in its place.
