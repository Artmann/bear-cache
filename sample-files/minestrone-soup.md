This minestrone soup recipe is a delicious version of the classic Italian
vegetable soup. Serve it with crusty bread for an easy vegetarian meal!

Today, I have two goals: to bake a batch of
[Christmas cookies](https://www.loveandlemons.com/easy-cookie-recipes/) and to
make a pot of minestrone soup. To me, the two go hand-in-hand. After I spend an
afternoon baking (and eating!) something sweet, I want nothing more than a
warming, nourishing pot of soup for dinner at night.

I love this minestrone soup recipe in particular because it’s so satisfying, but
still light and fresh. Onions, carrots, and celery add depth of flavor to its
herb-flecked tomato broth, and starchy beans and pasta make it nice and thick. I
toss in green beans for texture, and, as a final finishing touch, I top it off
with fresh parsley and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. It’s super easy and
flavorful, and all you need is
[crusty bread](https://www.loveandlemons.com/no-knead-bread-recipe/) to make it
a meal. Cookies for dessert are optional, but highly recommended.

## Minestrone Soup Recipe Ingredients

Here’s what you’ll need to make this minestrone soup recipe:

- **Onion, carrot, and celery** – These vegetables create the aromatic base of
  the soup, known as a *soffritto* in Italian. You’ll sauté them in olive oil
  before adding the other ingredients.
- **Garlic** – It adds additional depth of flavor to the soup. You’ll stir it in
  after cooking the onions, carrots, and celery so that it doesn’t burn.
- **Diced tomatoes** – For sweet, tangy flavor.
- **Green beans** – They add vibrant color and crisp-tender texture to the soup.
- **White or kidney beans** – Navy beans, cannellini beans, and red kidney beans
  all work great!
- **Vegetable broth** – Use store-bought, or
  [make your own](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-make-vegetable-stock/).
- **Bay leaves, oregano, and thyme** – My easy version of a homemade Italian
  seasoning! These dried herbs add so much complexity to this simple minestrone
  soup.
- **Small pasta** – Think elbows, little shells, orecchiette, or ditalini. I
  like to cook it right in the soup so that it releases its starches into the
  broth.
- **Fresh parsley** – For garnish! Fresh basil would be excellent here too.
- **Red pepper flakes** – Optional, for heat.
- **And Parmesan cheese** – This salty, umami garnish takes the soup over the
  top.

## Variations

If you don’t have these exact ingredients on hand, don’t worry. As Alice Waters
writes in _The Art of Simple Food_, minestrone soup is endlessly customizable.
Part of the beauty of this recipe is that you can change it up to use what’s in
season or what you have on hand. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Substitute chopped [fennel](https://www.loveandlemons.com/what-is-fennel/) for
  the celery.
- Replace the green beans with diced zucchini or yellow squash, or use a mix of
  all three.
- In the summer, use diced fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned ones.
- Stir in fresh greens, like spinach or kale, near the end of the cooking time.
- No pasta? Swap in a quick-cooking grain like
  [pearled farro](https://www.loveandlemons.com/farro/) or barley.
- Instead of using canned beans,
  [cook your own](https://www.loveandlemons.com/cannellini-beans-recipe/)! Then,
  use the aromatic cooking liquid in place of some or all of the vegetable broth
  in this soup.

## Minestrone Soup Serving Suggestions

This recipe is best right after it’s made, as the pasta absorbs the broth as it
sits in the leftover soup. If you want to make it ahead of time, I recommend
cooking the pasta separately and stirring it into the soup as you’re ready to
eat. Alternatively, you can skip the pasta and add an extra cup of beans to the
soup. Prepared this way, the soup will keep well for up to four days in the
fridge.

When you’re ready to eat, top each bowl with a sprinkle of parsley, red pepper
flakes, and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. If you’re vegan, feel free to skip
the cheese, or garnish your bowl with a scoop of
[vegan pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/vegan-pesto/) instead. (Non-vegans
take note: [regular pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/pesto-recipe/) is also
a great topping for minestrone soup!).

Serve the soup with
[good crusty bread](https://www.loveandlemons.com/no-knead-bread-recipe/) and
call it a day, or round out the meal with a side salad. This
[arugula salad](https://www.loveandlemons.com/arugula-salad/), this
[beet salad](https://www.loveandlemons.com/beet-salad-recipe/), and this
[pear salad](https://www.loveandlemons.com/pear-salad-recipe/) would all be
fantastic with this minestrone soup. Enjoy!
