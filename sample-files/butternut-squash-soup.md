My favorite fall tradition is making butternut squash soup on Sunday afternoons.
On a brisk day, thereâ€™s nothing more soothing than chopping and simmering
vegetables over a warm stove. As you cook, the kitchen fills with the cozy scent
of sage, rosemary, and butternut squash, and when youâ€™re finished, steaming
bowls of butternut squash soup (that will last all week!) reward you for your
work.

In the past, my go-to butternut squash soup recipe has included
[coconut milk and curry spices](https://www.loveandlemons.com/red-curry-kuri-squash-soup/),
but this fall, I found myself craving one that was a bit more traditional. When
I say traditional, I donâ€™t mean that I use chicken stock, heavy cream, or butter
in this recipe. Itâ€™s a delicious, all-veggie healthy butternut squash soup with
ginger, sage, and rosemary. This is basically fall in a bowl.

Weâ€™ve been loving this soup lately â€“ itâ€™s creamy and nourishing, perfect for
satisfying cozy fall cravings. With only 10 ingredients, itâ€™s easy to make, so
cook a big batch today, and enjoy the soup all week long! Happy fall. ðŸ™‚

#### Butternut Squash Soup Recipe Ingredients

To make this easy butternut squash soup recipe, you need 10 simple ingredients:

- **Butternut squash â€“** This soup packs in 3 pounds of squash, so look for a
  medium-large one at the store or farmers market. If you donâ€™t have a scale at
  home, I recommend weighing the squash when you buy it!
- **Yellow onion and garlic â€“**Â These veggies add delicious depth of flavor.
- **Fresh sage and rosemary â€“**Â I donâ€™t reach for rosemary as often as some
  other fresh herbs, but I absolutely love it here. Along with the sage, it
  makes this soup cozy and complex.
- **Ginger â€“** Its warm flavor highlights the autumnal taste of the herbs and
  squash.
- **Extra-virgin olive oil â€“**Â 2 tablespoons add the perfect amount of richness.
- **Vegetable broth â€“** Because the blended squash becomes creamy on its own,
  thereâ€™s no need for dairy, coconut milk, or nuts here! With veggie broth as
  its base, this is a vegan butternut squash soup recipe.
- **Salt and freshly ground black pepper â€“**Â Add them with the onion at the
  start of the cooking process, but make sure to taste and adjust at the end as
  well. That way, youâ€™ll make a soup you really love!

Letâ€™s cook!

First, chop the veggies! SautÃ© the onion until it becomes translucent, add the
squash, and cook until it begins to soften. Then, stir in the herbs, garlic, and
ginger. Pour in the broth and simmer until the squash becomes tender, about 20
minutes.

When the squash is soft, transfer the soup to a blender. Blend until the soup is
vibrant orange and creamy. Finally, pour it into bowls, garnish with chopped
parsley and pepitas, and enjoy!
